# Simon Says

Simon Says is a simple game which I hope will display my ability to write more complex software.

You can see the game in action here:

## Technology

After finishing the book Head First HTML 5 I decided to do this next project with plain, simple HTML5. As per Derek Siver's recomendations (https://sivers.org/learn-js).

I copied and modified some CSS code for the strict switch found on w3schools. Thank you w3schools.

So yes, the technology desciption of this project is very simple. 

No libraries, just core technology.


## Problems
* Users have infinite time to decide next color to click (add time limit to moves)
* Make the display white text which overlays the color buttons for a cleaner look
